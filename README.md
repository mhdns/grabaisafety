# Grab AI Challenge - Safety

_Note: All the required files for the prediction is  available in the folder, the template file can give some insights on how to use the predictor module. The data_exploration folder has the Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration and model selection. Due to lack of excess to comuting power the deep learning portion of the exlporation was done seperately._

## Instructions
Step 1: Import the DriverSafetyPredictor class from the predictor module.\
Step 2: Initiate a instance of the DriverSafetyPredictor\
Step 3: Use the load_data method to load the data. The data loaded should be a pandas dataframe with columns matching exactly the training set provided.\
Step 4: Use the predict method to predict the outcome. The results are stored in a variable called report which is a pandas dataframe that can be exported or used in any other analysis.
